# 🎓 Course Mark & Grade Management System

The **Course Mark & Grade Management System** is a Java-based group project developed for **SCSE1224: Advanced Programming** at **Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)**.

This project focuses on designing and implementing a realistic academic management system while applying core **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** principles such as **inheritance, aggregation, and composition**.



## 📌 Project Overview

The system simulates a university course management environment where:

- Students are registered for multiple courses  
- Lecturers are assigned to teach specific courses  
- Course marks and grades are managed centrally  

The application reads required data from **CSV files**, loads them into corresponding class instances, and provides role-based functionalities for **students**, **lecturers**, and **administrators**.

**Key Capabilities**
- Students can:
  - View marks and grades for registered courses
  - Calculate their CGPA
- Lecturers can:
  - View student performance
  - Update marks and grades
- Administrators can:
  - Assign lecturers to courses
  - Add or manage courses
  - Perform general system administration tasks



## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Apply **inheritance** to model hierarchical relationships between classes  
- Implement **aggregation** and **composition** to represent real-world object relationships  
- Develop a **modular, maintainable, and extensible** Java application  
- Practice **team collaboration** using version control



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **Data Storage:** CSV Files  
- **Concepts Applied:**  
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
  - Inheritance  
  - Aggregation & Composition  
  - Encapsulation & Modularity
